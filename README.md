 ## A Note about ```/``` for Windows Users

  You'll see many commands prefixed with ```./```, or paths containing the ```/``` (forward-slash) character.

If you're using the Windows Command Prompt, then you'll need to replace ```/``` with ```\``` (back-slash) for these commands and paths to work as expected.

On Windows Powershell, these substitutions are not required.
